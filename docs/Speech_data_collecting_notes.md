# Speech data recording, storing, pre-processing

## Recording:

* 5-10 hrs of speech
* Texts that are not copyrighted/we are allowed to use/share with open licence
* Record preferably studio quality data (44.1 kHz, 16-bit minimum) in .wav
* Speaker metadata, informed consent forms

While recording, **keep track on mistakes, hesitations or any changes the speaker does to the text while reading!!!**

## Storing:

* Where to store a) speech data and b) metadata

## Pre-processing:

* Aligning speech data and text on phoneme level (use [WebMAUS](https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSBasic))
* Filename system - consistency!
* A big data table showing the content and information of EACH FILENAME
* Allows mass renaming and other mass python operations to be done to the files
